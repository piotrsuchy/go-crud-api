# Go CRUD API Basic Project

In this repo I've put the code for a simple CRUD API made with Golang. All the code is within the main.go file and there's no frontend, however I've tested it with POSTMAN API calls:

## GET ALL

A screenshot from postman after sending a GET ALL get request:
![GET ALL](media/POSTMAN_GET_ALL.png)

## CREATE

A screenshot from postman after sending a CREATE get request:
![CREATE](media/POSTMAN_CREATE.png)

A screenshot of GET_ALL after creating with the earlier request:
![AFTER CREATE](media/POSTMAN_AFTER_CREATE.png)

As you can see, there's a new entry.

## UPDATE

A screenshot from postman after sending a UPDATE put request:
![UPDATE](media/POSTMAN_UPDATE.png)

The value for the director has been changed.

## DELETE

A screenshot from postman after sending a DELETE del request:
![DELETE](media/POSTMAN_DEL.png)

Any entry with an ID in the request would be deleted.

## Final Thoughts

This is my first project in Go.
